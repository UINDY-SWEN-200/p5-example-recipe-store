# Homework Project 5

This week weâ€™re going to learn the basics of HTML/CSS in the context of a GUI framework: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

In addition to the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) documentation itself you can find many useful videos and tutorials. Here are a few that I think are pretty good:

* [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
* [Li Hau: Writing your first Svelte Component](https://youtu.be/fhQ3o6tbhKQ)
* [Joy Of Code: Svelte for Beginners](https://joyofcode.xyz/svelte-for-beginners)
* [Bitfumes: Full Svelte Course](https://youtu.be/AilOdkZGeOk)
* [Mozilla: Getting Started with Svelte](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started)

# Requirements

We're going to build on the code from project 4 to create a recipe application completely in Svelte.

Copy your project 4 classes to the lib folder. Edit the 'page.svelte' file to implement the recipe application.

Points will be distributed as follows:

- 20% Includes an "add item" form component that dispatches a custom Svelte `submit` action.
- 20% Displays the recipe in a tabular form that permits recipe items to be deleted
- 20% Keeps the recipe items in a Svelte `store` obejct (rather than a `SimpleDB`) and this store is access by a component that displays the number of ingredients.
- 20% Uses correct Typescript typing
- 20% Uses consistent and clean style
